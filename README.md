🔍 Project: MITRE ATT&CK Threat Analysis 🔍

In this project, I analyzed suspicious PowerShell activities and mapped them to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, and Credential Access. The investigation involved:

Identifying file creation, deletion, and system info gathering.

Mapping behaviors to specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Recommending defensive measures like SIEM tools, IDS/IPS, and firewall configurations.

This project showcases my skills in threat analysis, cybersecurity defense, and incident response.
